# graxel

_Pocket pixel editor made to be shared_

It genuinely serves no purpose, except relaxing me. It's like the gravel pattern in Japanese gardens but with pixels. It was also a nice way to experiment the Share API, sadly only Chrome mobile let enjoy all its potential. Also, there's an easter egg.
